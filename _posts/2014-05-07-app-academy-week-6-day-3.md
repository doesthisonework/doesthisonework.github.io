Today's project might have been the most fun so far. After a couple of days getting down the fundamentals of server side JavaScript, moved on to some client side JS. Using HTML5 canvas and JS we built... Asteroids! 

Until today I certainly couldn't say that I had built a replica of a classic arcade game that is actually playable in browser. Also, it's certainly satisfying to have a project where at the end you can enjoy the fruits of your labor by shooting things and watching them blow up. Okay, my version might be pretty basic right now - everything is just represented by different size circles, but I'm going to continue working on it and build out into a full-fledged playable browser game. Stay tuned for a link to the finished version once it's completed.

Tomorrow we're continuing to work with front end JS, adding jQuery into the mix. Basically, Our homework for tonight was to learn jQuery - pretty much the whole thing. Which is why this is a late and relatively short post. Now, back to work!
