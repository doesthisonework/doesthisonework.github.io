The big announcement that everyone has been waiting for was finally made this morning: guidelines for final projects! I have an idea for what I'd like to do, but I'm not ready to reveal it here yet. Stay tuned.

For the rest of the day, we continued our work with Backbone.js on top of Rails, this time building an RSS news feed app. For whatever reason I felt like Backbone's design patterns totally clicked with me today and pretty quickly we were able to get a feed reader app going with some pretty cool features. Ours dynamically updated the feed content every two minutes, and you could click on individual feed entries to get an expanded view of that entry's content without reloading the page. It was pretty clear how this could pretty easily be built out into a more fully-featured RSS feed reader app, and pretty amazing to realize that something like that could be built in just a day.

Now that Backbone is becoming more familiar to me, I'm really excited about the possibilities presented by a one page dynamically updated web app. This is something I'll definitely be incorporating into my final project... to be announced soon!
