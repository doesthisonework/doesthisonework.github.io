I'm feeling ever more conflicted between not wanting to lose sense of awe at how well ActiveRecord works and my burning desire to know *how* it works. Today was more practice creating tables, making associations, and writing custom validations for our models in Rails. It's absolutely amazing how well Rails can infer what you mean and save you a ton of time spelling out trivial associations and methods. 

This is one of the beautiful things about Rails and Ruby in general: you don't need to know how every part works, you just need to trust that it does, and know how to use it. This is what makes it so quick and easy to write incredibly powerful software with a smattering of keystrokes using RoR. 

I can't help it though: I want to know how it all works. I want to break it down, and build it back up, piece by piece, until I know exactly what every piece does. Lucky for me, that's exactly what we're doing tomorrow: a solo day building "ActiveRecord Lite" from scratch. So we'll see if I still like the magician's tricks after the curtain has been peeled back.
