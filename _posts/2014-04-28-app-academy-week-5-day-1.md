We are gradually stepping up the complexity of the Rails projects every day. Today, the goal was to build a social networking/link sharing app - my partner and I called ours Friend Ovals. Just like some other social networks you might have heard of, in Friend Ovals you can add friends, group them into ovals, and then share links and posts among your ovals. 

This was a great project for once again practicing authorization and authenticating user sessions - the thing that has been drilled into us for nearly a week now - as well as some models and HTML forms of higher complexity than we've worked with so far. After an entire weekend of practicing Auth, my partner and I were able to bash out what once would have taken us nearly a full day in about an hour, leaving us lots of time to play around with our models of ovals, users, posts, and links, and their associated controllers and views.

We took a stab and making some more complex HTML forms that involved more layers of nested data. The ultimate challenge that my partner and I took on was creating a signup page that also allowed users to make their first post to the site right when they create and account. There were all kinds of data to handle all in one form and a single controller: user, post, and links. This one made my brain hurt a bit, but we were able to solve it and get it working by the end of the day. Major win.

Tomorrow is part II of our [ActiveRecord Lite](http://www.mattpetrie.net/2014/04/18/app-academy-week-3-day-5/) project from week 3, this time building it out into full-on Rails Lite. I'm excited for this one, but considering how challenging rebuilding ActiveRecord alone was, I'm sure it's going to be a tough day.
