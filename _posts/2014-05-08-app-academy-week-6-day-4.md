Today we continued our client side JS practice by adding jQuery to the mix, and tossing in a little CSS to style up our pages as well. We warmed up by building simple browser UI's for a couple of games that we had made before: Tic Tac Toe and Towers of Hanoi. Then it was on to a new game: Snake.

I confess to thinking that today would be a breeze, since I already have pretty decent HTML and CSS skills, and have used jQuery a bit too on some of the static sites that I've built. However, I found trying to make a game UI with jQuery to be pretty confusing. I love how easy jQuery makes many things, but for this it just didn't feel like the right tool for the job, especially after experiencing the awesome powers of HTML5 canvas yesterday.

Building Snake did give us some good practice with jQuery tools like event listeners though, and getting to style up our pages with CSS was pretty fun too. It felt like a bit of slog at first, but after a couple extra hours of work tonight, I'm actually pretty happy with my snake game (I had a little fun with the CSS).
