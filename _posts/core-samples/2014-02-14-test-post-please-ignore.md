This is a test post to see how blog posts look when they aren't quite so crazy long as the example post.

This is much closer to what the lengths of my actual posts will be like.

Here's some code to see how that looks:

{% highlight ruby %}
def foo(bar)
  bar.each do |word|
  puts word.upcase
  puts "Hello World! 101010"
end
{% endhighlight %}
Let's see how that renders!
