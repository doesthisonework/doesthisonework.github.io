End of week 6... official half-way point of the full 12-week App Academy experience. I confess to feeling a mixture of sadness and relief at having reached this far. The pace at which we are learning is absolutely brain- bending, I honestly think it would be impossible to keep up for ever, so I'm glad that for the first time the end is visible on the horizon. However, I'll also definitely miss the experience once it's over. I can unequivocally say this is the most intense and challenging learning environment I've ever been in. I've been pushed to the absolute limits of my abilities, but I've also been pushed to accomplish more than I would have ever imagined possible. Cool.

Today we wrapped up our first week of JavaScript by returning to Rails, and throwing in some jQuery and AJAX to dynamically update content on our pages. It was nice to be back in the now-familiar environment of Ruby and Rails after all the JS with all its semicolons and brackets and parentheses, but honestly I feel like I've got enough of handle on JS where that stuff doesn't bother me anymore. I did catch myself absent mindedly adding the occasional semicolon to the end of a Ruby line though.

I  am hoping to get some work done on improving my Asteroids game this weekend, but we're also expected to start learning Backbone.js in preparation for Monday, plus we have our JS assessment on Monday. Oh, and I've got to read [Effective JavaScript](http://effectivejs.com/) too. So I don't know how much time I'm going to have for side projects. As one our TA's would say, "keep on drinking from the firehose."
