We took a break from our Ruby and JavaScript development today to play around with Twitter Bootstrap. If you're not familiar with [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), it's one of the most popular frameworks on the web for quickly styling web sites. If you just returned from clicking that link and discovering Bootstrap for the first time, I'm sorry for having just ruined half of the internet for you. Bootstrap gives you many tools for easily styling your site, but it's default styles have become so common that they're a bit of a cliche. Once you get familiar with the style you'll start noticing it everywhere. The key, of course, it to learn the fundamentals of the framework so you can start to add your own personal touches to it.

This was a welcome easy day for me after all hitting Backbone.js so hard the past few days. I already had a bit of experience building [static websites](http://www.eponymousdesign.com/) with Bootstrap, but it was nice to get some more practice, and some familiarity with how Bootstrap integrates with Rails. I also took the opportunity to learn more about [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), which is a huge improvement from writing vanilla CSS.

One other fun discovery of the day: if you need filler text for your site mockups there are [tons of great lorem ipsum generators](http://mashable.com/2013/07/11/lorem-ipsum/) to choose from.
