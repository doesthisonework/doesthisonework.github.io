It all ends to today: no more non-descriptive variable names, no more for/while loops, no more methods that drag on line after line. Starting today, every line of Ruby code gets written in as Rubyish a manner as possible. 

Many of the exercises today were relatively simple algorithms that I was already familiar with or had even solved before, like Bubble Sort, Rock Paper Scissors, and an RPN Calculator. However, I challenged myself (along with my pair) to write them in as concise, readable, and elegant a manner as possible.

We were often pushed out of our comfort zone, and had to rethink situations where we tempted to use, say, an iterator variable, and come up with the right built in Ruby methods to produce the result we wanted. It was frustrating to have to be rethinking problems we already knew we could solve, but looking through our beautiful code at the end was certainly satisfying.

###Tic Tac Toe
Writing a Tic Tac Toe program was definitely one of the most challenging projects I've taken on to date. Even some of the very basic challenges took some careful thinking as to how to approach, for example, figuring out how to accurately (and clearly) represent the board in a way that is also going to be easily searched and checked against. This was also my first attempt at writing an (albeit very primitive) AI.

One thing that this project definitely helped me grasp was the value of organizing your methods into classes. Combined with my resolution to write clearer code today, figuring out where and how to most logically organize our methods definitely took some careful consideration, but once we had a our basic classes set up it made it so much easier to conceptualize how to approach each step of the problem. Plus, it made debugging so much easier since we could keep track of how all the pieces fit together (which came in handy when we realized we had to do one major refactor - lesson learned: when dealing with arrays, think carefully about what's more important to you - the values or the indexes!).
