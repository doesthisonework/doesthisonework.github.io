Assessment #3 this morning. This one was on SQL queries and associations in Rails, and I finally managed to bag myself a perfect score on an assessment. I studied so hard that I literally dreamed about SQL queries last night. It wasn't so much that I was struggling to understand the material, but I wanted to make sure I was ready to nail this one. And nail it I did, with more that half and hour to spare. It was a great relief to finally end an assessment with a nice, pleasant list of perfectly green RSpec specs.

###APIs and JSON
Our projects today were to make a couple of small apps using some web APIs. First we made an "Ice Cream Finder" script, using Google's Places API, that finds and give directions to ice cream vendors near your location. The hardest thing about this project was really just sifting through the massive JSON strings from the API's responses, justs trying to find the couple of pieces of data we actually needed. Thankfully, the [JSON Formatter](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-formatter/bcjindcccaagfpapjjmafapmmgkkhgoa?hl=en) Chrome extension came in very handy for this. While it was a headache sorting through all that JSON, I came away with a much, much better understanding of JSON and how computers communicate with each other using this format.

Second, we built a Twitter client in Rails, geting some experience using Twitter's API and authentication tools. I have to say, it was pretty satisfying to actually [send a tweet](https://twitter.com/MattPetrie/status/458374801434759168) from my very own Twitter app. I'd really like to flesh this project out into a full-fledged command line Titter client when I have time. A client with a name as awesome as TerminalTwit3000 can't just be put out to pasture.
