After an intro from (Ned) we jumped right in to our first pair programming experience. This was one of the things I have been most looking forward to in the course, since up until this point I've pretty much taught myself everything I know about code in a complete vacuum. I was both curious and nervous about how this would go: what if my partner was way more (or less) advanced than me? What if we had really different approaches to a problem?

Thankfully, my partner Eddie and I seemed to be on the same wavelength from the get go. Apart from some expected awkwardness as we figured out how to assume our roles as "driver" and "navigator", we fell into a good rhythm together and to whole thing felt surprisingly natural pretty quickly.

This being day one, we started off with some review of some pretty basic Ruby concepts: arrays, hashes, and the Enumerable module. While the coding problem weren't any more challenging than anything I had encountered in the whole process of getting here, I think both my partner and I were a little rusty and it was useful to have someone to fill in the gaps when we would get tripped up on remembering syntax, built-in methods etc.

While the challenges may not have presented anything new conceptually, I definitely felt our solutions were some of the cleanest, most concise code I had ever written. There's definitely a difference between understanding a concept and what you can do when you start to understand it deeply.

I was particularly proud of our solution to the "numbers into words" (100 = "one hundred", etc.) problem, which involved my most ambitious attempt to use recursion to date. Not only were we able to get our recursive solution to work, we were able to refactor our code into a pretty concise little function before we were done. I've always found recursion to be a tricky concept for me to think through, and this was the first time I felt like I really nailed it. Now I'll probably be trying to solve problems recursively left and right just to see if it can be done.

My brain is definitely swirling after day one, but I can't wait to dive in to more tomorrow.
