###Assessment 2
Assessment day. This time on OO design with Ruby using RSpec TDD. The project was to build out a Crazy Eights game, including a computer player AI, from a pre-built skeleton. I felt really well prepared going in, after both building Poker at the end of last week, and practicing by building Blackjack using a similar skeleton over the weekend. Classes, subclasses, factory methods, instance variables - those things are all old hat now.

...Which is why I'm kicking myself for narrowly missing getting a perfect score - I missed two specs in the allotted hour. Lesson learned - read the specs. READ THE SPECS! Carefully. In the two that I missed, I wrote a method that produced the desired result, but didn't make a call to a required helper method. If I  had just taken a step back and carefully read the error message and a comment in the spec file, I would have easily been able to fix it. One little change to one line of code and I would been resting in happy fields of RSpec green. I won't be getting burned by that again.

###Many flavors of SQL: Postgres, MySQL, and SQLite3
This week it's on to SQL databases. I'll confess that after building so many really fun little Ruby programs last week, it's tough to go back to just writing database queries. However, it is useful to get a better understanding of something so fundamental to virtually any application at the ground level. 

I don't have any prior SQL experience really, and so getting the hang of the syntax, and keeping track of all the different types of JOINs, etc. was a bit awkward at first -- tough to have to put the training wheels back on just as Ruby is feeling so fluid. But, I feel like I'm getting that hang of it. In many ways it's kind of amazing that something so simple in principle - a bunch of tables with rows and columns of data- could so powerfully drive the apps we all know and love. 

Tomorrow we start integrating our SQL skills with Ruby, so I'm looking forward to putting the pieces back together.
