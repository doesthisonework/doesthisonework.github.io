We started JavaScript today. After 5 weeks of Ruby, it was really tough to have to put the training wheels back on with a new language. In fact, we started off by basically going through all of week 1's Ruby exercises and redoing them in JavaScript.

I thought I might have a leg up in this part of the course because I actually started learning JavaScript before I learning Ruby. However, I quickly learned that was not to be the case, since I really only ever learned enough to perform simple jQuery functions, and it took all of one day for the relentless curriculum to outpace my rudimentary knowledge.

I used to really love JavaScript. It's a language whose history is so deeply entwined with the rise of the modern internet, and it is still the language that powers much of the internet in pretty amazing ways. It's sheer flexibility alone is something to be appreciated: front end, back end, JS can do it all. 

After learning Ruby, I'm still in love with what JavaScript can do, but perhaps a bit less enamored with it's syntax. Today's exercises were for the most part not particularly challenging: merge sort, bubble sort, binary search, these are algorithms that I know like the back of my hand at this point, but I found myself repeatedly tripping over closing parentheses, semicolons, and variable declarations.

We'll see how I feel in a couple weeks though, maybe once I get to the point where I can unleash some of the true power of JS, I'll be willing to forgive it a semicolon or two.
