We made it to views! Views: the final cog in the Model-View-Controller machine that makes web applications the world over work their magic. Views: the part turns all that fancy stuff going on under the hood into a real, live, human-viewable web page. 

We got to practice creating some views today for our very own 99dresses.com clone - "99cats" (*the* place to rent cats!). While it was exciting to finally get to generate some browser viewable pages, in the interest of keeping things focused and simple, we weren't allowed to use any CSS or fancy HTML tricks. Hello internet circa 1994! Still, it gave us ample opportunity to practice building forms for data using embedded Ruby, and also a good opportunity to continue brushing up on routes and controllers from yesterday.

Tomorrow we add authentication into the mix, which, if tonight's reading is any indication, could be a real headache. I suppose I'll find out!
