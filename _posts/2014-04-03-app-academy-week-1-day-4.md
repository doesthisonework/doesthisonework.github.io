I thought I had recursion down. I really did. I've even solved a few of the coding exercises earlier in the week recursively, which was making me feel ever more bold. Then today happened. Ow. My. Brain.

I thought I had the basic technique down: find the base case, figure out how you would solve the base case +/- 1, and then you are well on your way. My pair and I were blazing through the first several (admittedly simple) exercises today and were feeling pretty confident about our abilities to think recursively. Fibonacci numbers? No problem. Binary search? Got that down too.

But one recursive problem that you're not conceptualizing well can ruin your whole day. When it happens to me, it's almost like my brain is getting stuck in the very same stack overflow my method is - I'm just spinning through the processes over and over again without ever getting anywhere. Very frustrating and exhausting. I now get my reasoning error for the problem I got stuck on today (lesson learned: if starting from the bottom isn't working, remember to try starting from the top!), but I'm going to have to keep working to make sure I get recursive solutions intuitively in the future.

The first several days were hard, but left me proud of how much I had learned. Today was humbling. I was reminded of how far I still have to go. But today was today, tomorrow is (today + 1).
