RSpec. At first it feels awkward. It feels like everything now takes twice as long as if you were to just write the code you want to write. Then you realize how much easier you just made life your yourself.

No more endlessly chasing down reoccurring bugs. You know where the bug is, and once you have your classes and methods written, you know they work. You know they do exactly what you want them to do. I'm definitely still working on getting the particulars of RSpec syntax and writing my own tests down, but I definitely already have appreciation for how much more efficient writing good tests can make me as a developer.

Today's project was to build a five-card draw poker game using Test Driven Development with RSpec. It felt strange at first have to decide so much about what you were going to do before actually writing the code, to have to really think through what a particular method was going to do before even beginning to write it. But that's part of the beauty of RSpec. 

If you write good specs, it forces you to organize your code into manageable pieces. You realize what you're going to need as you write it out. By the time you get to actually writing the code, you have a pretty clear outline for your program, and you know exactly what to write for each method. The actual coding practically feels like it just does itself.

I'm definitely glad to have finally reached another well earned weekend after an intense week 2 at App Academy. I'm tired and my brain is definitely very full of code. However, once again it's pretty great to realize how far we've come in such a short period of time. Next week, it's time to dive in SQL. Just when we're getting the hang of one topic, it's on to another. But that's just the pace of life here.
