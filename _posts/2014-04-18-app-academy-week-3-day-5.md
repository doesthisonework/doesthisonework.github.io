Today was without a doubt the most challenging, but also one of the most fulfilling, days of the course so far: rebuilding our own ActiveRecord. This involved several "metaprogramming" techniques that we hadn't been introduced to before: methods that build other methods, create instance variables, and infer things like class and table column names.

Every step was challenging because you really had to think carefully about how every piece was going to fit together, and about exactly what every method was doing in the context of the larger program. It felt like an accomplishment to "hack" the basic functionality of Ruby in so many ways though, and it really gave me appreciation for the incredible flexibility of the language to become whatever you need it to be - this is the magic of everything being an object. What's more, I feel like I have a much, much deeper understanding of what's going on behind the scenes in my Rails projects now, which will definitely come in handy in the future. 

I'd love to take my newly acquired skills and try my hand at writing a domain specific language someday. Of course considering the daily workload here, that day is going to be a long way off.
