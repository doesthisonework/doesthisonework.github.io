Today I rebuilt Rails from scratch, alone. Those are certainly words I would not have even imagined typing a mere 4 1/2 weeks ago. Granted, I had a little help from some documentation and RSpec specs to guide me on my way, and my "Lite" version is nowhere near as feature rich as the real thing, but combined with the ActiveRecord Lite project from Week 3, all the basic pieces are there Models, Views, Controllers, cookies, params hashes. 

I won't say that this was the hardest project to date, I actually think writing ActiveRecord was harder because of all the SQL interactivity, but it certainly was challenging. I also definitely came away with a *much* deeper concept of what's actually going on behind the scenes. The curtain has been pulled back a bit to reveal the wizard.

Another thing that happened today: I needed to right a method and and actually thought, "you know, this would be much easier to do recursively." Yet another thing I couldn't imagine thinking just a few short weeks ago.
