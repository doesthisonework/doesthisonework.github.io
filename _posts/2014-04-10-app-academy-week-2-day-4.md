Today was an opportunity to reflect on how far we've come: our first solo day. Would we still be able to write clean, functional code without a partner to exchange ideas with and to catch our mistakes?

The project was Checkers (the American version, or English Draughts). After completing Chess yesterday, the plan of attack was pretty clear in terms of the basic classes (Board, Piece, Game), and how to handle movement and board state. Sure enough, within a few hours I had a fully working checkers game including a decent UI. It was pretty cool to realize I was capable of something like this that would have been completely out my league just a couple weeks ago.

Tomorrow, we dive into RSpec, which I am thankful for after testing out my Chess and Checkers games by hand (I got very good at performing the [fool's mate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fool's_mate). Reading up for tomorrow also gave me another opportunity to reflect: one assignment was to read the specs from our pre-course assessment, which gave me a chance to review my now-laughably primitive code.

I've really enjoyed what limited experience I've had so far with Test Driven Development - mostly from completing [Michael Hartl's Rails Tutorial](http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book). I've found writing specs to be yet another great tool for helping me organize my thoughts and plan my approach to a problem, so I'm really looking forward to an opportunity to really master using it.

For now though, it's back to Black vs. Red.
