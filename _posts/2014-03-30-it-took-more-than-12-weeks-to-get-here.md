Well... I'm here. It's nearly midnight and I'm about to spend my first night at App Academy's offices in San Francisco. I had the opportunity to meet about half of my cohort earlier tonight, and I'm truly blown away but what a smart and diverse group they are. And that's only half of them! I can't wait to meet the other half tomorrow. I would be lying if I said I wasn't more than a little bit intimidated right now, but it's also hard not to be excited for what's ahead.

###It takes more than 12 weeks to get here
As I sit here in the darkened office, about to retire to my inflatable twin matress for the first time here, I can't help but reflect on the path that brought me here. I'm sure it must seem miraculous to many (it certainly did to me) that it could be possibe for any program to provide enough training in 12 short weeks to actually produce qualified programmers. 

However, as I stare down the barrel of those 12 weeks, I can't help but think about how it was more than a year ago now that I wrote my first line of JavaScript. I never wrote any Ruby until I applied for App Academy, but I started cramming pretty hard once I did, and that was in September - more than 6 months ago now. So while the program itself may only be 12 weeks, already it's really provided the framework that has guided my learning for most of the past year of my life. 

I don't know entirely what the next 12 weeks have in store for me, but already everything I had to do just in striving to get here has been immesurabley valuable to me. Maybe that's part of the magic of the "bootcamp" model.

###I'm grateful beyond words
It's also hard for me at this moment not to be incredibly humbled by all of the effort and sacrafice by other people that helped me get to this point, particularly by my wife who completely willingly and trustingly went along with packing up our entire life just so I could pursue this crazy dream of mine. I have truly put everything on the line, and there's no turning back now. Tomorrow it all begins. Here we go.
