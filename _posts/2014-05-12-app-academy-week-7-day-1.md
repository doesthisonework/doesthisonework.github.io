Tomorrow we dive fully into client side MVC with Backbone.js, but before getting to that, today we built our own "Backbone ultralite" to get a feel for what goes on under the hood of the Backbone library.

Without the help of Backbone, we had to write our own getter and setter methods to update the attributes of our models, and hand build jQuery ajax requests so that the client side JavaScript could update and be updated by the Rails back end.  We also wrote our own custom event listeners to trigger callbacks that dynamically updated our pages on events like form submissions.

It was definitely helpful to understand how this all works, but I can't wait to unleash the power of Backbone tomorrow so we can start writing some truly cool client side apps.
