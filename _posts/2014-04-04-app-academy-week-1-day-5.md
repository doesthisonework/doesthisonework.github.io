If I sound incoherent writing this, it's because it's nearly 3am, and apart from a break to get a post-first week celebratory drink with some of my cohort mates, I've still been working on my code from today.

Today we focused on data structures, and algorithms for searching them - specifically Depth First Search and Breadth First Search. I was familiar with the basic concepts, but this was really my first attempt to do anything substantial with them in Ruby.

We built a node tree using a class, and then experimented with using the different search algorithms on our tree, and then using the same structure, built a program that could map the path of knight between any two points on a chess board. It was pretty cool to see how quickly

Next it was on to mapping all the possible moves on a tic tac toe board (that was pretty easy after dealing with the chess knights). But where things got interesting was using out tree of tic tac toe moves to build an unbeatable tic tac toe playing AI. That's where I still am at 3 am, working out bugs in my AI code. I'm determined to figure it out on my own without looking at the answer, and I know I'm painfully close. Although I think at this point it's going to have to go on the giant stack of projects for this weekend.

It's incredible to think back to just a week ago and realize how much I've learned. I had a dubious at best understanding of recursion even a couple of days ago, and now can for the most part write all kinds of recursing methods with relative ease. My code also looks a hell of a lot cleaner. It's almost comical going back to problem I know I have solved before and re-solving them with just a few lines of code. It's been an intense week, and I'm exhausted, but I'm looking forward to what's in store next.
